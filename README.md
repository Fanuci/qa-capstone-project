QA Capstone Project â€“ ParaBank 

Overview 

This repository contains the deliverables for my ParaBank Capstone Project, completed during a Software Testing Bootcamp. The goal of the project was to simulate a real-world QA workflow, covering the full cycle from requirement analysis to test closure.  

The project gave me hands-on experience in:  

Requirement analysis and validation  

Test planning and strategy design  

Test case design and execution (positive, negative, boundary, and edge cases)  

Defect logging, tracking, and reporting  

Mapping requirements to test cases (traceability)  

Preparing a final test summary report with sign-off decision

This project demonstrates my ability to manage the QA lifecycle from requirement analysis to defect reporting and final sign-off, like what is expected in real QA roles.
